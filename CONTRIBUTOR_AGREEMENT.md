## Contribution Procedure

We develop this project using the Git version control system on the Github platform. All contributions must be made using these mechanisms.

### Bug notifications

Please follow the following procedure before submitting a bug notification:

1. Make sure you’re on the latest version. The issue may have already been resolved in a later modification. Always update the repository to the latest version before testing a bug.

2. If you’re running the latest release, try rolling back to a previous stable release to verify if the problem is present. This will allow to more accurately identifiy the moment in which the issue was introduced.

3. Try switching versions of dependencies, first to the latest available, and them to previous ones, as discussed above.

4. Verify this is not a known issue by reading the project's known issues documents and the release notes of the versions you tested.

5. Consider also searching the mailing lists and discussion channels to see what information has been shared by the community regarding the problem you identified.


### Bug fixes and features

Please follow the following procedure before submitting a bug fix or new feature:

1. Always make a new branch for every modification you submit, even code style improvements. If submitting different modifications with different functionalities or to different code modules, make a new branch for each of them. This way, the reviewers and other team members can more easily understand the functionality you are proposing and follow the evolution of the code base. This also allows the maintainers to accept or reject each modification individually.

2. Submit bug fixes to the most recent version they are present on. Bugs in the release branch must be submitted to it. Bugs fixes in the development and working branches must not be submitted to a stable code branch.

3. Submit new features to the master branch.

4. Always include a git commit comment with a description of your fix or feature with any contribution.

5. Include unit tests for all the code you submit, including minor bug fixes, this helps keep the code base stable and also helps the maintainers understand the intended effects of your code.
