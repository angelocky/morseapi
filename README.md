# Morse Code Input API for Android

This is the working repository for a project intended to build an input method that can be used in Android in a standard manner, but defines a pluggable API to allow any source to provide a symbol stream that is then translated into a binary character stream and interpreted by the input method as their coresponding character inputs.
